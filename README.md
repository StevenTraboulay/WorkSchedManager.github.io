Process
-------
added skeleton for HTML
created a work day (for my self, as i usually work 12 hours)./
This skeleton feeds into the bootstrap CSS styles as well as the given styles from the source code./


------
initiated CSS
--------------
CSS was fairly standard - kept the same as source code, may update on sunday/

-------
initiated Script
----------------

initiated the scripting for the functions/
need to find what clicks and what clicks to watch out for/
where to save and what to do/

function to continue update hour and colour scheme initialized/

interval  update/


trying to loop the hours without building a whole array having an issue right now/

requested assistance on the local storage issue.  if unable to solve will default to individually pulling/


My error was in using "hour" instead of "#" to pull the class ID and not spacing the " .description" correctly as that interfered with the styling/
